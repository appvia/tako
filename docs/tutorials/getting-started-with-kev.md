# Getting started with Kev

This tutorial will walk you through how to **connect your Docker Compose Workflow to Kubernetes** - using Kev.

This is NOT a migration. On the contrary, we're going to create a continuous development workflow.

Meaning, your hard-earned Docker Compose skills will make it faster to develop and iterate on Kubernetes.

We'll set up Kev, iterate and deploy a [WordPress application](https://docs.docker.com/compose/wordpress/) onto Kubernetes.

The tutorial assumes that you have,
- Prior [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) experience.
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
- [Kev installed](../../README.md#installation).
- A local Kubernetes installation. This tutorial uses Docker Desktop ([Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes) / [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#kubernetes)). As an alternative, use [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) or [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

As we walk through the tutorial we'll cover some Kubernetes concepts and how they relate to Docker Compose and Kev.

These will be explained under a **Kube Notes** heading.

Finally, we'll use the term "Compose" to mean "Docker Compose".

## Create your docker-compose config

Let's start by creating an empty project directory and `cd` into it.
```sh
$ mkdir kev-wordpress
$ cd kev-wordpress
```

Then, add a bare bones `docker-compose` file with a basic description of our `wordpress` service that looks like this,
```sh
$ cat <<EOT >> docker-compose.yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    restart: always
EOT
```

This Compose config,
- Sets a `wordpress` service.
- Exposes the service on port `8000`.
- Adds a `restart` always restart policy.

To confirm this is a valid configuration, let's start `wordpress` locally,
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d    # Run in the background. Force recreate the containers.
```

Navigating to [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000) in a browser, should display `wordpress`'s setup page.

Ace, we're all good, let's stop the service,
```sh
$ docker-compose down -v    # Stop all containers. Remove named volumes.
```

## Preparing for Kubernetes

Compose and Kubernetes address different problems.

_Compose_, helps you wire, develop and run your application locally as a set of services. It's super for development.

_Kubernetes_, however, is designed to help you run your application in a highly available mode using clusters and service replications. It is production grade.

Describing Compose services as a Kubernetes application requires an extra layer that translates concepts from one to the other.

Furthermore, on Kubernetes, you might also want to deploy or promote your app to different "stages", commonly known as environments. Application configuration may vary depending on the environment it is deployed to due to various infrastructure or operational constraints.

So, a good approach to managing your app configuration in different environments is a must.

Kev will help you with all the above! So let's get cracking.

### Compose + Kev

Let's instruct Kev to track our _source Compose_ file, `docker-compose.yaml`, [that we've just created](#create-your-docker-compose-config).

Kev will introspect the Compose config and _infer the key attributes_ to enable Compose services to run on Kubernetes.

Also, as we're moving beyond development, we'll instruct Kev to create two _environment overrides_ to target two different sets of parameters (annotated in a service's `x-k8s` extension).

Please note, a `dev` sandbox environment is always created alongside any specified environments.

No time to lose, let's get started...
```sh
$ kev init -e local -e stage
```

This generates the following output:
```sh
» Verifying project...
 ✓  Ensuring this project has not already been initialised

» Detecting compose sources...
 ✓  Scanning for compose configuration
 ✓  Using: docker-compose.yaml

» Validating compose sources...
Detecting secrets in: docker-compose.yaml
 ✓  None detected in service: wordpress

» Creating deployment environments...
 ✓  Creating the dev sandbox env file: docker-compose.kev.dev.yaml
 ✓  Creating the local env file: docker-compose.kev.local.yaml
 ✓  Creating the stage env file: docker-compose.kev.stage.yaml

» Detecting Skaffold settings...
Skipping - no Skaffold options detected

Project initialised!
A 'kev.yaml' file was created. Do not edit this file.
It syncs your deployment environments to updates made
to your compose sources.

And, the following deployment env files have been created:
    dev: docker-compose.kev.dev.yaml
  local: docker-compose.kev.local.yaml
  stage: docker-compose.kev.stage.yaml

Update these to configure your deployments per related environment.

You may now call `kev render` to prepare your project for deployment.
```

You can see that Kev tells you exactly what it is doing at each stage of execution, and also tells you what files it creates.

Kev has now been initialised and configured. It has,
- Started tracking the `docker-compose.yaml` file as the _source application definition_.
- Inferred configuration details from the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
- Assigned sensible defaults for any config it couldn't infer.
- Created `dev` (a sandbox used by Kev for continuous development), `local` (useful for testing on our own machine) and `staging` (useful for testing on a remote machine) _Compose environment overrides_.

It has also generated four files:
- `kev.yaml`, a manifest that describes our _source application definition_ and _Compose environment overrides_.
- Three `docker-compose.kev.*.yaml` files to represent our _Compose environment overrides_.

#### Manifest: kev.yaml

The `kev.yaml` manifest file confirms a successful `init`,
```yaml
id: b903b060-9762-4a59-8131-47e129f70256
compose:
  - docker-compose.yaml
environments:
  dev: docker-compose.kev.dev.yaml
  local: docker-compose.kev.local.yaml
  stage: docker-compose.kev.stage.yaml
```

#### Compose environment overrides: docker-compose.kev.*.yaml

The created `dev`, `local` and `stage` _Compose environment overrides_ are currently identical.

The `x-k8s` extension section for each service enables you to control how the app runs on Kubernetes. See the [configuration reference](../reference/config-params.md) to find all the available options and understand how they affect deployments.

We'll be adjusting these values soon per target environment. For now, they look as below,

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  wordpress:
    x-k8s:
      workload:
        livenessProbe:
          type: exec
          exec:
            command:
              - echo
              - Define healthcheck command for service wordpress
        replicas: 1
```

## Moving to Kubernetes

Admittedly, our `wordpress` app is very basic, it only starts a `wordpress` container.

However, all the translation wiring is now in place, so let's run it on Kubernetes!

### Generate Kubernetes manifests

First, we instruct Kev to generate manifests for the required Kubernetes resources.

> **Kube Notes**
>
> Our single `wordpress` Compose service requires [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-app/deploy-intro/), [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/) and (an optional) [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) Kubernetes resources.

Simply run,
```sh
$ kev render
```
which outputs the following:
```sh
» Loading...

» Validating compose sources...
Detecting secrets in: docker-compose.yaml
 ✓  None detected in service: wordpress

» Validating compose environment overrides...
Detecting secrets in: docker-compose.kev.dev.yaml
 ✓  None detected in service: wordpress
Detecting secrets in: docker-compose.kev.local.yaml
 ✓  None detected in service: wordpress
Detecting secrets in: docker-compose.kev.stage.yaml
 ✓  None detected in service: wordpress

» Detecting project updates...
dev: docker-compose.kev.dev.yaml
 ✓  No version update detected
 ✓  No service additions detected
 ✓  No service removals detected
 ✓  No env var removals detected
 ✓  No volume additions detected
 ✓  No volume removals detected
local: docker-compose.kev.local.yaml
 ✓  No version update detected
 ✓  No service additions detected
 ✓  No service removals detected
 ✓  No env var removals detected
 ✓  No volume additions detected
 ✓  No volume removals detected
stage: docker-compose.kev.stage.yaml
 ✓  No version update detected
 ✓  No service additions detected
 ✓  No service removals detected
 ✓  No env var removals detected
 ✓  No volume additions detected
 ✓  No volume removals detected

» Rendering manifests, format: kubernetes...
dev: docker-compose.kev.dev.yaml
 ✓  Converted service: wordpress
   | rendered Deployment
   | rendered Service
 ✓  Networking
   | rendered NetworkPolicy
local: docker-compose.kev.local.yaml
 ✓  Converted service: wordpress
   | rendered Deployment
   | rendered Service
 ✓  Networking
   | rendered NetworkPolicy
stage: docker-compose.kev.stage.yaml
 ✓  Converted service: wordpress
   | rendered Deployment
   | rendered Service
 ✓  Networking
   | rendered NetworkPolicy

Project manifests rendered!
A set of 'kubernetes' manifests have been generated:
    dev: k8s/dev
  local: k8s/local
  stage: k8s/stage

The project can now be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

To test locally:
 - Ensure you have a local cluster up and running with a configured context.
 - Create a namespace: `kubectl create ns ns-example`.
 - Apply the manifests to the cluster: `kubectl apply -f <manifests-dir>/<env> -n ns-example`.
 - Discover the main service: `kubectl get svc -n ns-example`.
 - Port forward to the main service: `kubectl port-forward service/<service_name> <service_port>:<destination_port> -n ns-example`.
```

In this case, Kev,
- Has re-introspected our _source application definition_.
- Has NOT detected any config changes that need to be applied to our _Compose environment overrides_.
- Has generated Kubernetes manifests to enable our app to run in `dev`, `local` and `stage` mode.

We're now ready to run our app on Kubernetes!

### Running on Kubernetes

This means we need to deploy our newly minted manifests to a Kubernetes cluster.

Run the following commands on your local Kubernetes (we use [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes)).

>**Kube Notes**
>
> - We're using `kubectl`, the Kubernetes CLI, to apply our manifests onto Kubernetes.
> - We utilise the [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) `kev-local` to isolate our project resources from other resources in the cluster.
> - Our `wordpress` container runs as a single [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) as we're only running 1 replica.
> - The `service/wordpress` is a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/) that proxies the `Pod` running the container.
> - To access the `wordpress` container from our localhost we [port forward](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/) traffic from `service/wordpress` port `8000` to our localhost on port `8080`.

We'll be deploying our app in `local` environment mode.
```sh
# create a namespace to host our app
$ kubectl create namespace kev-local
namespace/kev-local created

# apply the generated k8s/local to our namespace
$ kubectl apply -f k8s/local -n kev-local
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/default created
deployment.apps/wordpress created
service/wordpress created

# make the wordpress service accessible on port 8080
$ kubectl port-forward service/wordpress 8080:8000 -n kev-local
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8000
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8000
Handling connection for 8080       # When we connect to 8080 via browser
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080]) in your browser. This should display `wordpress`'s setup page - the same `wordpress` web page you saw when we ran `docker-compose up -d` earlier.

Hurray!! We're up and running on K8s using **JUST our Compose config (with sensible Kev defaults)**.

For now, `ctrl+c` to stop the `wordpress` service. We need to move beyond a basic container.

## Add a DB service

Let's wire in a database to make our basic `wordpress` app more useful.

In this case this means adding a `db` service backed by a `mysql` container to our Compose config.

### Update Compose config

Update the source `docker-compose.yaml` to,

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    volumes:
        - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: somewordpress
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_USER: wordpress
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
volumes:
  db_data:
```

This adds,
- A new `mysql` service.
- A volume `db_data` to store the `mysql` data.
- Environment variables to configure the `mysql` service.
- Environment variables to configure the `wordpress` service to use the `mysql` db.

Running,
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
...
Creating network "wordpress-mysql_default" with the default driver
Creating wordpress-mysql_wordpress_1 ... done
Creating wordpress-mysql_db_1        ... done
```

Navigate to [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000) in a browser.

You should now see a `Welcome` screen for _the famous five-minute WordPress installation process_.

This confirms that all is well.

Stop the service by running,
```sh
# Stop all containers. Remove named volumes.
$ docker-compose down -v
```

### Re-sync Kubernetes

Now, that we have a new `db` service and `db_data` volume we need to let Kev _infer the key attributes_ to enable the new Compose service and volume to run on Kubernetes.

Also, we've made some minor adjustments to the `wordpress` service. Kev will reconcile those changes.

This will be applied to all _Compose environment overrides_.

We have already initialised kev, so to catch the new changes to the Compose file we simply need to re-run,
```sh
$ kev render
```
which now gives us some slightly different output to our first run earlier in the tutorial (note the following is abridged for brevity, highlighting relevant new output):
```sh
» Loading...

» Validating compose sources...
Detecting secrets in: docker-compose.yaml
 !  Detected in service: wordpress
   | env var [WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD] - Contains word: password
   | env var [WORDPRESS_DB_HOST] - Contains word: host
   | env var [WORDPRESS_DB_USER] - Contains word: user
 !  Detected in service: db
   | env var [MYSQL_USER] - Contains word: user
   | env var [MYSQL_PASSWORD] - Contains word: password
   | env var [MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD] - Contains word: password

To prevent secrets leaking, see help page:
https://github.com/appvia/kev/blob/master/docs/reference/config-params.md#reference-k8s-secret-key-value

dev: docker-compose.kev.dev.yaml
 ✓  Converted service: db
   | rendered StatefulSet
   | rendered Service
   | rendered PersistentVolumeClaim
 ✓  Converted service: wordpress
    ...
 ✓  Networking

 ✓  Converted service: db

   | rendered StatefulSet
   | rendered Service
   | rendered PersistentVolumeClaim
 ✓  Converted service: wordpress
    ...
 ✓  Networking
    ...

Project manifests rendered!
...
```

This time round, Kev has:
- Found secrets in our update Compose file, and warned us about the potential for leakage,
- Detected and inferred config for the new `mysql` service and `db_data` volume,
- Assigned sensible defaults for any config it couldn't infer, and
- Re-generated the kubernetes manifests for the `dev`, `local` and `stage` deployment environments.

>**Kube Notes**
>
>To accommodate the `db` service, Kev uses the [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) Kubernetes resource as the `db` service requires persistent storage.
>Kev uses the [PersistentVolumeClaim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) resource to provide the `db` service with the required `db_data` volume it needs to store data.

We'll be re-deploying our app in `local` environment mode.

Run the following command on your local Kubernetes instance (we use [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes)).

```sh
# re-apply the re-generated k8s/local manifests to our namespace
$ kubectl apply -f k8s/local -n kev-local
persistentvolumeclaim/db-data created
service/db created
statefulset.apps/db created
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/default configured
deployment.apps/wordpress configured
service/wordpress configured
```

**This BREAKS our running app** - to fix it we need to understand how service discovery differs between Compose and Kubernetes.

### Fix DB service discovery

In our Compose config, the `db` service does not have a `ports` attribute, meaning it is not exposed externally as there are no published ports.

This is not an issue for dependent Compose services as containers connected to the same user-defined bridge network effectively expose all ports to each other and communicate using service names or aliases.

**Kubernetes is different**. To help our `wordpress` containers connect to the `db`, Kubernetes requires an explicit `Service` resource.

The fix is simple, we need to instruct Kev to recognise `db` as service that will be accessed from other services.

Simply add the `ports` attribute to the `docker-compose.yaml` file as below,

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  db:
    ...
    ...
    ports:
      - "3306"

  wordpress:
    ...
volumes:
  ...
```

Then, re-render and re-deploy,
```sh
$ kev render
...

# re-apply the re-generated k8s/local manifests to our namespace
$ kubectl apply -f k8s/local -n kev-local
service/db created
...

# make the wordpress service accessible on port 8080
$ kubectl port-forward service/wordpress 8080:8000 -n kev-local
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8000
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8000
Handling connection for 8080
```

Navigate to [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000) in a browser.

... and Yay!! Live on Kubernetes, you should now see the `Welcome` screen for _the famous five-minute WordPress installation process_.

`ctrl+c` to stop the `wordpress` service.

## Run more replicas

As it happens, we have a requirement that our `stage` environment should mirror `production` as much as possible.

In this case, we need to run 5 instances of the `wordpress` service to simulate how the app works in a heavy user traffic setting.

Let's make this happen. We need to edit our `docker-compose.kev.stage.yaml` Compose environment override file.

We'll change the: `x-k8s.workload.replicas` value from 1 to 5.

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  wordpress:
    x-k8s:
      workload:
        ...
        replicas: 5
```

### Re-sync Kubernetes

When we re-sync Kev, the `stage` environment's generated manifests will reflect the new number of `replicas`.

```sh
$ kev render
...
```

Re-deploying the manifests to Kubernetes on a `stage` environment will run 5 `wordpress` [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) on Kubernetes - meaning 5 `wordpress` instances.

We now have 3 different target environments,
- `dev` will only run a single `wordpress` instance.
- `local` will only run a single `wordpress` instance.
- `stage` will only run a 5 `wordpress` instances.

These are easily tracked in easy to understand Compose files.

Check the [configuration reference](../reference/config-params.md) if you want to configure other params.

## Conclusion

We have successfully moved a `wordpress` app from a local Docker Compose development flow to a connected multi-environment Kubernetes setup.

Kev facilitated all the heavy lifting. It enabled us to easily iterate on and manage our target environments.

We also have an understanding of the **gotchas** we can face when moving from Compose to Kubernetes.

All the generated manifests can be tracked in source control and shared in a team context.
