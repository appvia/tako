# CI workflow example with a simple Node.js app

This example walks through using Tako in a commit based CI pipeline.

You will setup CircleCI to render, build, push and deploy to a remote staging environment.

We assume that you,
- Use [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) for source control and can push to a remote Git repo.
- Have a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) account connected to your Git repo.
- Have a [kube-config file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) with access to a remote cluster.

## Get Tako

* Download [Tako](https://github.com/appvia/tako/releases/latest) & add it your `PATH`.

## Prepare for CI

### kube-config file

We need to connect our CI deployment to a remote cluster using a `kube-context` setup to access the remote cluster. This context will be defined in a `kube-config` file.

Make a copy of this `kube-config` file and remove any kube-contexts that do not relate to our final deployment.

> kube-config file: slimmed kube-context example.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:
    insecure-skip-tls-verify: false
    server: https://xx.xx.xx.xx
  name: remote-cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: remote-cluster
    user: a-user
  name: remote-cluster-context
current-context: remote-cluster-context
preferences: {}
users:
- name: a-user
  user:
    auth-provider:
...
```

Now encode the slimmed down `kube-config` file into base64.

```sh
$ cat ~/path/to/remote/cluster/kube/config | base64
```

Then create the following [CircleCI Project Environment Variables](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project),
- `KUBE_CONFIG_STAGING`, to store the `kube-config` base64 value there.
- `KUBE_CONTEXT_STAGING`, to store the value of the `kube-context` there.

### Docker registry

We will also add `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_TOKEN` as CircleCI Project Environment Variables.

These allow us to push our app's image to a secure docker registry. Should that be a private registry then make sure that the remote Kubernetes cluster is able to [pull images from it](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/).

### config.yaml

Here is the [CircleCI config file](../../examples/node-app/.circleci/config.yaml). It will create a CI pipeline that is triggered by a commit to your Git repo.

It assumes the necessary **CircleCI Environment Variables have been setup**, and the target cluster has a `staging` namespace already setup.

It also depends on the Tako staging environment that we will be creating shortly. Here's the relevant step that performs the actual deployment,

> CircleCI Deploy step: render staging, use Skaffold to build, push and deploy your app to Kubernetes.
```yaml
...
...
      - run:
          name: Deploy
          command: |
            echo ${KUBE_CONFIG_STAGING} | base64 -d > ${KUBE_CONFIG_STAGING_FILE}
            ./bin/tako render -e staging
            ./bin/skaffold run --kubeconfig ${KUBE_CONFIG_STAGING_FILE} --kube-context ${KUBE_CONTEXT_STAGING} --profile staging-env --namespace staging
...
...
```

## Initialise project

To follow the tutorial, make a copy of the project directory (`./examples/node-app`).

> Inside the copied project directory (`./examples/node-app`) instruct Tako to:
> * create a `staging` based Kubernetes environment configuration.
> * prepare the app for use with [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/).

```sh
$ tako init -e staging --skaffold
```

You will notice the staging environment configuration file has been created:

> Added environment specific override files:
```sh
...
|- docker-compose.env.staging.yaml      # staging env
```

Adjust your Kubernetes `staging` application parameters for each of the components as needed. This is done via Compose [extensions](../../docs/reference/config-params.md).

Also, you'll find that Tako has bootstrapped a Skaffold config file (`skaffold.yaml`). If a `skaffold.yaml` file previously existed, then the additional profiles will be added there.

Our CI pipeline will be using this Skaffold config file to power builds, pushes and deployments.

## Iterate on the application and commit

Iterate on the application as [described here](simple-nodejs-app-workflow.md#iterate-on-the-application).

When you're happy, commit the latest and push.

## App deployed to staging

The commit will trigger the CI pipeline.

After the `stage` job successfully finishes, inspect that the Node app is running in your remote cluster:

```sh
# List Kubernetes application pods for the Node.js app:
$ kubectl --context <remote_cluster_context> -n staging get po

NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
app-69d87ffbc8-wgs6   1/1     Running   0          9s
```

That's it! If you have an [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) configured then navigate to the correct Url.

Alternatively, you can choose to [port-forward](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/) the service and test the app on your localhost.
